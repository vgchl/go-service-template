# go-service-template

Draft template for Go microservices. See [main.go](main.go), [app.go](app/app.go) and [service.go](service/service.go) for the meaty bits.

Intended to be converted into a [cookiecutter](https://www.cookiecutter.io/) / [cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) template for easier deployment and maintenance.
